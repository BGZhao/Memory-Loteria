MEMORY-LOTERIA
Lotería (Spanish word meaning "lottery") is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo, but using iconic images in Mexican culture on a deck of cards instead of numbers.


Lotería Mexicana’s simplest variant consists of the following rules:

1.- There is a deck with 54 cards, each card has an image of Mexican culture, but this version only have 10 cards.
2.- Since this is my own version, I will make each image a memory card. 
3.-There is single player
4.-There’s a Cantor (Announcer), who would tell you about each card history.
5.-Players have to match the cards with the same image, accumulating points.
